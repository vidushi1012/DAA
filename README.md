## Problem Statement
Sort a matrix of positive integers using insertion and selection sort. Show how they are related and pros and cons.

---
## How to use code
First of all clone the github repo <br/>
---
#Download project
git clone https://github.com/vidushi1012/DAA.git <br/>

---

#go to assignment-1
cd assignment_01

.
.
```
---

Run the code
```
gcc main.cpp
```

### Theory <br/>
Insertion sort- is a simple algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.<br/>
Selection sort- is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison based algorithm in which the array is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire array.


### Time Complexity
INSERTION SORT <br/>
Best Case - O(N) <br/>
Average Case - O(N^2) <br/>
Worst Case - O(N^2) <br/>

SELECTION SORT <br/>
Best case = Average case  = Worst case = O(N^2) <br/>

then run the code on any cpp compiler <br/>
